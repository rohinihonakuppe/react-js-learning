React JS -
- JS library used for creating reusable UI components
- Provided by Meta
- Known for speed, simplicity, scalability

Advantages -
-Easy to learn and use
-Uses Virtual DOM to improve performance
-Unidirectional databinding
-Developer tools

Vite
- A build tool for faster development
-Spin up the dev server

Commands to create & run a project
>npm create vite@latest <project name>
>cd <projectname>
>npm install
>dev run npm

After the Vite dev command=>
Started the development server =>vite served the files as ES(ECMAScript ) modules by dynamically transforming jsx to js.

2. vite build
optimize the code => Transforms JSX to JS => Performs tree shaking & Code splitting.=> minification & Optimization => Create Output

3. Components - Its a building block of react components. 
Types of component
-class components
-function component

4. JSX
-mix of JS & HTML
-Follow Camel casing convention
-JSX helps to create virtual DOM by returning HTML

5. React Fragments
-Group all the html elements in between tag <></> or in <div></div>or<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>

-<StrictMode></StrictMode> A helper that helps to write better react code by having additional checks to identify potential risk & prevent from side effect
-it used in development only

Databinding - 
-A mechanism to bind data values to HTML elements
-supports one way binding by using {}
-useState hook should be used to maintain state and it support two way binding
-useRef - Hook that is used to get reference to a DOM node.

Virtual DOM
-A memory representation of the DOM and sync with real DOM by using package ReactDOM
-React will updates only the necessary part changes occurs.
- it improves the performance of your application.

useEffect -
A function that run the code based on dependencies provided
it will automatically trigger based on state changed
useEffect(() ={
}, [dependencies])
